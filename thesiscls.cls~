%% muthesis Class for LaTeX2e.
%% This is an update of a version that changed many hands, C. Gareth Few has cleaned it up and fixed various things 
%% with the help of Caroline Alexander, we suffered...so you don't have to.

%% Note that this makes no attempt to deal with multi-volume thesis -
%% if you do one that long you deserve everything you get.
%%
%% 1) Page numbering starts on the title page and is roman (i.e. title
%%    page is no.i but does not display it), numbering in arabic restarts 
%%    from 1 on the first page of the introduction (you must have \pagenumbering{arabic} in your first chapter).
%%
%% 2) The preface will consist of the following sections in the
%%       following order!
%%         i)    Title Page
%%        ii)    Declaration
%%       iii)    Abstract
%%        iv)    Contents page (actually we shall be fancy and have a
%%               table of contents, list of tables and list of figures.
%%         v)     Anything else you want, such as acknowledgements
%%
%% 3) We set baselinestretch to 1.6 which is close enough to double spacing,
%%    actually it depends on font size if you are being pedantic but this is 
%%    an acceptable spacing and nobody notices the difference.%%
%%
%% 4) The binding (left hand) margin must be 40mm, other margins must be 20mm, 
%%    with page numbers falling within these margins. The binding margin is thus 
%%    rather large, even when you take the binding (normally about 10mm) into account.
%%    You will not be rejected however for being a little off, this is mainly to 
%%    safeguard against overlapping text with the binding.
%%
%% 5) Bibliography: as long as you are consistent there should be no trouble, you can 
%%    use the ``alpha'' style for the writing process but I recommend switching to apalike 
%%    before submission. 
%%
%% 6) I have included here an environment called ``chapterabstract'' which puts an abstract in 
%%    at the start of a chapter but doesn't reset page numbers as the normal environment would.
%%
%% 7) Any extra things you want to put in -
%%    acknowledgements etc, should come after the mandatory preface
%%    sections and before the first chapter. Unless you have done a ``by publication'' style 
%%    thesis you may want to think about including any of your publications as appendices. 
%% 
%% 8) For more advice you can ask another student who is finishing up and probably dealt with any 
%%    problems you encounter, or you can (but please try yourselves first) email c.gareth.few@googlemail.com.
%%    Additions/corrections to this class file or anything else in the thesis bundle on the JHI wiki 
%%    are welcome, but please make sure you test your update before replacing this.

    \bibliographystyle{apalike}
    \bibliography{mybib}


Documentation:
    It sets the margins and interline spacing and
    disallows page breaks at hyphens.

    The \beforeabstract command creates the title page, a copyright
    page (default), and a signature page (optional), the tables of
    contents, tables and figures. The signature page is not mentioned
    in the rules for submission, and by implication are not allowed.

    The user then includes the preface using the
    \prefacesection{Abstract} command.

    Next should come an \afterabstract command to insert the declaration.

    Then the user should put preface section(s), using the
    \prefacesection{section title} command. The first of these should
    be the statement of education and research, others may be
    acknowledgements etc.

    The \afterpreface command then  sets things up to start
    the main body (continuing the sequence of page numbering, but
    putting page headings etc.).

    Having one of \beforepreface or \afterpreface without the other
    may cause problems, so u don't do it.
    
    The following commands can control what goes in the front matter
    material:
    
        \title{thesis title}
        \author{author's name}
        \dept{author's department}
                - Radio Astronomy if omitted
        \principaladviser{the principal advisor's name}
           (or \principaladvisor, if you prefer advisor spelled with o)
        \firstreader{the first reader's name}
        \secondreader{the second reader's name}
        \submitdate{month year in which submitted to GPO}
                - date LaTeX'd if omitted
        \copyrightyear{year degree conferred (next year if submitted in Dec.)}
                - year LaTeX'd (or next year, in December) if omitted
        \copyrighttrue or \copyrightfalse
                - produce or don't produce a copyright page (true by default)
        \figurespagetrue or \figurespagefalse
                - produce or don't produce a List of Figures page
                  (true by default)
        \tablespagetrue or \tablespagefalse
                - produce or don't produce a List of Tables page
                  (true by default)
        \sigpagtrue or \sigpagfalse
                - produce or don't produce a signature page 
                  (again false by default, as Manchester theses don't
                   require this. However, it's left in so that you can
                   your own `examiners page' if you like!)

        If you set all these to false, then perhaps you don't want any 
        preface at all, so perhaps you hould leave out both \beforepreface
        and \afterpreface -).

The example above shows the 12pt substyle being used.  This seems to give
acceptable looking results, but it may be omitted to get smaller print.
