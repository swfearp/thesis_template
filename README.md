Most of what you need to know can be found at the top of the thesisclc.clc file or in thesis.tex

You can use ./compile.sh to compile your thesis, all you need to do is add some content to the chapters, add entries to your bib file 
and fill in your name and title etc. Please consult the university guideline though, because somethings may change and just 
because it is included here is no guarantee that it works.

Happy writing!
